# This is how to get started using our host!

If you don't have a server already, then we recommend you buy one! If you've already purchased a server, then simply follow this steps:
    
    1- After we've received the payment, you should get an email that will guide you in order to set your password. (If you didn't get an email, please make sure to check Spam, and/or Promotions.)
    2- We will, after verifying everything's correct and that you agree to our legal documents, we may create your server, do note that, if we find any illegal activity/something that breaks our ToS/payment fraud, or anything else, your server will be terminated inmediatly.
    3- Enjoy!
